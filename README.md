🎯 Guess the Number Game (Java)

This is a simple Java console game where the program generates a random number and the user has to guess it.

I made this project to practice basic Java concepts like loops, conditional statements, and taking input from the user.

Getting Started
Make sure Java is installed on your system.

Compile the program:
javac Main.java

Run the program:
java Main

How It Works

- The program generates a random number when it starts.
- The user enters guesses through the console.
- After each guess, the program tells whether the number is too high or too low.
- The game ends when the correct number is guessed or when attempts are over.

Features

- Random number generation
- Console-based user input
- Simple game logic
- Feedback after each guess


Tech Used: (Java & Java standard libraries (Scanner, Random))

Notes

This is a small personal project created for learning and practice.
It can be improved further by adding difficulty levels or a GUI in the future.
